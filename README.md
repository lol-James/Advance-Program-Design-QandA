# NCUE CSIE Advance Program Code

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of various common and classic algorithm problems. The problems are arranged in increasing difficulty, allowing you to gradually build up your problem-solving skills.

## Structure
The code is organized into different folders based on the type of algorithm or data structure it focuses on. Each problem contains the solution along with explanations and code comments to help understand the approach.

## Topics Covered
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Examples include Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems related to optimization and decision-making.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Shortest path algorithms, depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), etc.
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, and other common search techniques.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimization problems solved using the greedy method.
- **Backtracking**: Solving constraint satisfaction problems like N-Queens, Sudoku, etc.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Algorithms that break problems into smaller subproblems, such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Number theory, combinatorics, prime numbers, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

## Problem Difficulty Levels
The problems are categorized into the following levels:
1. **Beginner**: Simple problems to get started with programming and basic algorithms.
2. **Intermediate**: Problems that introduce more advanced concepts and require more efficient solutions.
3. **Advanced**: Complex problems that test your understanding of algorithms and problem-solving skills at a high level.
